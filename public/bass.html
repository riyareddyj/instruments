<hr>
<p> A bass instrument (/beɪs/) is a musical instrument that produces tones in the low-pitched range C2–C4.[1] Basses belong to different families of instruments and can cover a wide range of musical roles. Since producing low pitches usually requires a long air column or string, the string and wind bass instruments are usually the largest instruments in their families. </p>
